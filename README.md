## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ElderlyCare-SmartHome
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 paho-mqtt pandas pyqtgraph matplotlib icecream
   ```

3. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   python data_acq.py
   ```

4. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   python start_elderly_care_system.py
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the System
1. Run the startup script: `python start_elderly_care_system.py`
2. This will start all emulators and the main GUI
3. Connect to the MQTT broker using the GUI
4. Monitor the system through the dashboard

### Individual Emulators
You can also run individual emulators separately:
- `python fall_detection_sensor.py`
- `python health_monitor.py`
- `python emergency_button.py`
- `python smart_lighting_controller.py`
- `python medication_reminder.py`

### Main Applications
- `python manager.py` - Data manager and MQTT broker
- `python gui.py` - Main GUI dashboard

## üìä Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following tables:
- `sensor_data`: All sensor readings and device data
- `elderly_devices`: Device configuration and status
- `emergency_logs`: Emergency events and responses
- `health_metrics`: Health monitoring data
- `medication_logs`: Medication compliance tracking

## üîß Configuration

Edit `init.py` to configure:
- MQTT broker settings
- Health monitoring thresholds
- Emergency response settings
- Database configuration

## üì± GUI Features

### Main Dashboard
- **Connection Status**: MQTT broker connection
- **Emergency Status**: Real-time emergency monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Vital signs display
- **Smart Controls**: Lighting and device control
- **Medication Management**: Schedule and compliance tracking
- **System Alerts**: All notifications and warnings

## üö® Emergency Response

The system provides multiple layers of emergency response:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Fall detection and health monitoring
2. **Manual Trigger**: Emergency button for immediate help
3. **Family Notifications**: Real-time alerts to family members
4. **Emergency Services**: Direct integration with emergency services
5. **Smart Home Response**: Automatic lighting and environmental controls

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

- Real-time health metrics tracking
- Emergency response time monitoring
- Medication compliance analytics
- System performance metrics
- Historical data analysis

## üîí Security & Privacy
